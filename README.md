# OpenOptics

OpenOptics is an advanced optical network management and analytics platform combining cutting-edge machine learning, federated learning, and security features.

## Project Components

- **Analytics**: ML-powered network telemetry analysis and anomaly detection
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for system interaction and monitoring
- **Security**: Quantum-resistant encryption and secure authentication
- **Federated Learning**: Distributed model training across network nodes

## Recent Enhancements

- Improved anomaly detection with standardized model evaluation metrics
- Enhanced federated learning with client-server communication
- Added support for model persistence using joblib
- Implemented secure model serialization with pickle and base64
- Updated API endpoints for federated learning operations

## Getting Started

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the main application: `python core.py`
