## Usage Examples

### Anomaly Detection

```python
from analytics.ml_engine import NetworkMLAnalytics

# Initialize analytics engine
analytics = NetworkMLAnalytics(telemetry_service, metric_store, topology_service, model_repository)
await analytics.initialize()

# Train anomaly detection model
config = {
    "metrics": ["power_levels", "ber", "osnr"],
    "model_type": "isolation_forest",
    "contamination": 0.01
}
result = await analytics.train_anomaly_detection_model(config)

# Detect anomalies using the trained model
anomalies = await analytics.detect_anomalies(result["model_id"])
```

### Federated Learning

```python
from federated_learning import FederatedClient, AggregationServer

# Initialize server
server = AggregationServer()
server.initialize_model(model_architecture="lstm", initial_weights=None)

# Initialize clients
client1 = FederatedClient(client_id="node_1", server=server)
client2 = FederatedClient(client_id="node_2", server=server)

# Train locally and submit updates
client1.train_local_model(local_data)
client1.submit_model_update()

client2.train_local_model(local_data)
client2.submit_model_update()

# Server aggregates and updates global model
server.aggregate_updates()
```
